<!-- h1>Intermediate target certification</h1>
<p>
    At the <a href="/">Archery Club</a>, you need to pass
    <b>The 18-Metre Test</b> before you can shoot the targets located
    at 18 metres and beyond.
</p>
<p>Cost: <b>Free</b>!</p>

<h2>Who needs to take this test?</h2>
<p>Any recurve archer who wants to shoot at 18 metres, except
    <a href="exec.php">current rangemasters</a>,
    are required to take this test.</p>
<p>Compound shooters, <a href="exec.php">talk to us</a> about possible
    exemption from this test.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>The 18-metre Test (aka "the test") consists of three areas of assessment,
    conducted simultaneously.</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Safety</b>: the ability to obey our <b>line calls</b>, as well
        as appropriate responses to unsafe situations.
    </li>
    <li><b>Score</b>: you must achieve 210 points out of a maximum of 300.</li>
    <li><b>Grouping</b>: your arrows must be of reasonable
        <a href="//google.com/search?q=grouping+(archery)">grouping</a>,
        where "reasonable" is <a href="exec.php">your examiner</a>'s call.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>You are allowed to use any bow that the club provides, or one that you
    personally own.
    However, you cannot change your bow once you have picked one.
</p>
<p>You are allowed to use any six arrows that the club provides, or
    six that you personally own.
    However, you cannot swap your arrows in or out once you have picked them.
</p>
<p>You are not allowed laser sights, tripods, and other "weird" aids.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>The 18-metre test is more lenient FITA version of assessments offered by
    <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Archery_Federation">the World Archery Federation</a>,
    where you shoot a <b>60cm</b> target from <b>10 metres</b>, instead of
    <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_archery#Scoring">40cm from 18 metres</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="exec.php">An examiner</a> will walk you through
    <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_archery#Scoring">the standard rules of
    international Olympic recurve archery scoring</a> and
    <a href="https://www.oaa-archery.on.ca/index.php?option=com_docman&task=cat_view&gid=24&Itemid=125">
    OAA's rules</a>.</p>
<p>You will be given one or two practice rounds (exactly three arrows).
   Your score for each round is the sum of the three arrows.
   If you shoot more than three, the lowest-scored three will be counted
    for the round.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If an arrow bounces off the target, but made a dent on the target, the
        score of the dent will be counted. <br />
        Do not shoot another arrow -- the three-arrow rule still applies.</li>
    <li>If an arrow bounces off the target, but did not make a dent on the target,
        that shot has a score of 0.</li>
    <li><b>Touching arrows on the target, yours or otherwise, without your
            examiner's permission, will result in 0 points for your round.</b></li>
    <li>Tempering with other competitor's private equipment will result in
        disqualification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>After passing</h2>
<p>Once you pass, you can shoot at the 18-metre targets.<br />
   You will also be allowed to shoot on Saturdays.</p>
<p>
    Passing this test <b>DOES NOT</b> make you a <a href="exec.php">rangemaster</a>.
