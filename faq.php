<p><b><a name="Fees"></a>How much to join?</b>
    <br/>Archery term membership: &dollar;20 (&dollar;15 if joining after our midterm date,
    different every year.)
    <br/>Also includes storage fees.
    <br/>* we do not accept &dollar;100 bills or loose change.
    <br/>
    <br/>You can also enter without a membership for &dollar;5 per day (these can only
    be obtained a maximum of three times in one term).
    These guest passes are not available to those who are beginners requiring
    full Instruction.
    Due to liability, a guest is defined as University of Waterloo member or an
    experienced archer if s/he is a non-member of University of Waterloo.
    Any non-University of Waterloo members who wish to participate in the UWAC
    must obtain an approval from the PAC manager.
    The Executives would request the approval on his/her behalf.
    <br/>
    <br/>For non-uwaterloo students,
    <br/>PAC term fee: <a href="http://clubs.uwaterloo.ca/clubs.php?club=10">&dollar;50-135</a>
    <br/>PAC day fee: <a
        href="http://clubs.uwaterloo.ca/clubs.php?club=10">&dollar;5</a>
</p>
<p><b><a name="Hours">When is the club open?</a>
    </b>
    <br/>Exact hours can be found at <a
        href="http://clubs.uwaterloo.ca/clubs.php?club=10">the campusrec
        website</a>.
    <br/>Shooting stops at the last 10-20 minutes of the hours of operation.
    <br/>The club may also be closed due to bad weather and insufficient
    staffing.
    <br/>
    <br/> <b><a name="Dangerous"></a>Is archery dangerous?</b>
    <br/>Hardly. However, any sport is dangerous if not done properly. It is
    important to observe
    line calls, to be patient, and to treat others and the equipment with
    respect. Participants are required to pay for any damage in equipment that
    is cause by his/her carless behaviour, e.g., 'dry-fire' the bow.
    <br/>
    <br/>Also, according to the club constitution, &quot;The Executive has the
    right to refuse/terminate membership to anyone at anytime whom it believes
    within reasonable grounds is a hazard to themselves, others, or club
    property.&quot;
</p>
<p><b><a name="Tryouts"></a>Are there try-outs?</b>
    <br/>Normally, no.
</p>
<p><b><a name="IAmNew"></a>What if I've never done it
        before?</b>
    <br/>That's fine, basic lessons are provided (included in your fees) on
    safety and
    form.
</p>
<p><b><a name="Bring"></a>What do I need to bring when I show up
        to the first session?</b>
    <br/>Your WatCard, <a href="#Fees">the fees</a>, and maybe a friend.
    Comfortable, non-baggy clothing (short sleeve shirt, or
    shirt with tight sleeves), and something to tie your hair
    back. If a hijab (headscarf equivalents) is worn, the ends must be secured
    to avoid interference with the bow.
    <br/>
    <br/>Do not wear things that can get caught: scarves, dangly
    earrings, a button-up shirt, or facial jewelry. Do not wear
    uncomfortable or movement restricting items, like
    stilettos, a corset, etc.
</p>
<p><b><a name="NeedEquip" id="NeedEquip"></a>Do I need my own
        equipment?</b>
    <br/>No, the club provides everything you need.
</p>
<p><b><a name="BringEquip" id="BringEquip"></a>Can I bring my own
        equipment?</b>
    <br/>Yes, as long as it is less than 55lb (in draw weight) and in safe
    working order, subject to club review.
    <br/>If using the club's arrows, the draw weight must be less than or equal
    to 40lb.
    <br/>Note: crossbows and other firearms are prohibited.
</p>
<p><b><a name="StoreEquip"></a>Can I store my equipment
        there?</b>
    <br/>Yes, subject to availability. It is stored at your
    own risk, and must be removed by the end of the term.
    Please speak to a club executive if you are interested.
</p>
<p><b><a name="Attendence"></a>Do I have to attend all
        nights?</b>
    <br/>No. After the first lesson (the safety lesson), you can come whenever
    you
    want. However, there are some reserved times for
    intermediate / advanced archers, as well as lessons /
    workshops for beginners.
</p>
<p><b><a name="Cap"></a>How many people are in the club?</b>
    <br/>Fall / Winter: 50-60, Summer: 20-30
</p>
<p><b><a name="CommonProblems"></a>What are common
        problems?</b>
    <br/>For first time archers: correct clothing, familiarity
    with equipment, and group safety are usually solved
    quickly. Intermediate archers will have trouble with poor
    form, equipment configuration "tuning", and athletic
    preparedness. Advanced archers typically have trouble with
    sport psychology, muscle strain due to heavier equipment,
    and small but signifigant form and equipment problems.
</p>
<p><b><a name="NotAStudent"></a>I am not a student. Can I join?</b>
    <br/>University of Waterloo Faculty, alumni, staff, and students can join.
    You must be a member of the PAC, and have paid all applicable fees.
    Otherwise, you cannot join as you are not properly insured.
</p>
<p><b><a name="Visiting"></a>I am visiting Waterloo. Can I use the facilities?</b>
    <br/>You must be a member of University of Waterloo. Subject to
    availability, you can: you must pay both the PAC day fee and the archery
    day fee.
</p>
<p><b><a name="Schedule"></a>What is the schedule?</b>
    <br/>You can find the schedule
    <a href="http://clubs.uwaterloo.ca/clubs.php?club=10">
        here</a>, including cancellations and times the facility is
    booked for tournaments or conferences.
</p>
<p><b><a name="History"></a>When was the club founded?</b>
    <br/>Well, sources suggest 1991, but we have documents left over from 1975.
</p>
<p><b><a name="Apply"></a>How do I become a rangemaster?</b>
    <br/>A rangemaster ensures order on the range. Please consult the
    <a href="docs/Archery%20-%20rangemasters%20guide.pdf">rangemaster's
        guide</a>
    for the application process, duties, and privileges.
